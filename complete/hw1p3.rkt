; == Homework 1, Problem 3 ==

; TODO: Define below the function salutation, which takes a first name, a last name,
; and a greeting word, and then produces a resulting combined welcome.
;
; Be careful to correct for capitalization in all inputs: no matter how
; they are supplied, all should be output with the first letter upper-case
; and the rest lower-case. For example...
;
; (salutation "hello" "jane" "doe") should result in "Hello Jane Doe"
; (salutation "WELCOME" "bOb" "SMiTh") should result in "Welcome Bob Smith"
;
; Hint: if you are doing the same process over and over... maybe that should
; be its own function?
; 
; You should include a signature and purpose for all functions you write.
; You can assume that all inputs will be a single word of at least one
; character.

; The function "fix" takes any string as input and returns the string with the
; first character uppercase and all following characters lowercase.

(define (fix str) ; EX: "miChAel"
  (string-append
   (string-upcase(substring str 0 1)) ; "m" -> "M"
   (string-downcase(substring str 1 (string-length str)))) ; "iChAel" -> "ichael"
  ) ; returns "Michael"

; The salutation function calls on the "fix" function for each variable so that
; each one is formatted properly.

(define (salutation first last greet)
  (string-append (fix greet) " " (fix first) " " (fix last))
  )
