; == Homework 2, Problem 1 ==

; The code below sums distances represented in nautical
; miles, kilometers, and meters. For example,
; (total-meters 1 2 3) computes the total
; distance of 1 nautical mile, 2 kilometers, and 3 meters,
; producing 1852 + 2000 + 3 = 3855 meters.

; total-meters: number, number, number -> number
; Takes an int of nautical miles, kilometers, and meters, and returns an int in meters

(check-expect (total-meters 1 2 3) 3855)
(check-expect (total-meters 4 4 4) 11412)

(define M-PER-NM 1852)
(define M-PER-KM 1000)

(define (total-meters nm km m)
  (+ (* nm M-PER-NM)
     (* km M-PER-KM)
     m))
